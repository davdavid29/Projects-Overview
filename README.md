### University Projects
#### Computer Engineering Projects
| Project Name & Link | Project Description | Year | Course  | Tools/Software |
|--|--| --| -- | -- |
| MATLAB GUI Keypad with DTMF Tones and Frequency Filtering | In this project, I use MATLAB's GUI functionality to design a keypad with buttons that are each assigned a unique DTMF tone. We also incorporate three graphs that display the DTMF input, filtered low frequency signal, and filtered high frequency signal. This project showcases the use of MATLAB's GUI capabilities and signal processing techniques. | 2021 | CPE 166 – Digital Signal Processing | MATLAB |
| Calculator Program with VB.NET 10 | This code implements a basic calculator program with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Visual Basic 2010. The program allows the user to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. It also includes a button to clear the current calculation and start over. The GUI includes textboxes to enter the two numbers and display the result, as well as buttons for each arithmetic operation. The program uses simple if-else statements to determine which operation the user wants to perform and performs the calculation accordingly. | 2020 | CPE 114_K12 – Software Design | Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 Express |
| Student Record Management System Code in C++ | This project implements a basic student record management system that allows the user to add, search, edit, and delete student records. The program stores the student's ID, course, name, age, and gender in a struct and can store up to five records. It uses a switch statement to determine which option the user chooses and uses loops to iterate through the student records. The program outputs the student records to the console. | 2019 | CPE 113_K12 – Data Structure & Algorithms | Dev C++ |
| ATM Machine Code in Java Swing GUI with MySQL Database | This project implements a basic ATM machine using Java Swing GUI and a MySQL database through the use of the phpMyAdmin web application. The user can input their account number and PIN, withdraw or deposit money, and check their account balance. The program connects to a MySQL database to store account information and transactions. It uses event listeners to detect button clicks and perform corresponding actions. The program displays account information and transaction history in the GUI. | 2019 | CPE 112_K12 – Object Oriented Programming | Netbeans and phpMyAdmin (for MySQL Database administration) |
